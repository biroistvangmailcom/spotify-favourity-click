# spotify-favourity-click
add a soptify shortcut on mobile to easily make a song as favourite.
I haven't found any easy solution to mark a song as favourite on spotify on fly.
I run or bike a lot and there were no app to make this simple button so i programmed one for it. 

usage:
create a Spotify API Secret on spotify dev page and edit the get_token.py and spotify_fav.py or put them in .env and use as variables.

install termux on your android device
add a shortcut on your .shortcuts folder for example .shortcuts/start.sh
add the content from start.sh
this shortcut can be added to amazon alexa as she always listens , if i say alexa favourite, she adds the currently played spotify track to my favourites.
